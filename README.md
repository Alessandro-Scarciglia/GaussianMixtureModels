# GaussianMixtureModels
A collection of Gaussian Mixtures Models (GMM) for clustering. This repo contains two of the most famous and widely used clustering models: *K-means* and *Expectation-Maximization* algorithms.

# Structure
*GMM.py* contains two classes implementing both K-means and EM. Each model can be exploited with two very simple steps: creating the model object with custom parameters and calling its *.run()* method specifying the number of iterations. An example of how to setup and use those models is provided in the file titled *test.py*.
